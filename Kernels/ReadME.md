There are 4 kernels to calculate the Connectivity Strength.

It must be noted that the 'TE' kernel is a modified version of [This Repository](https://github.com/mohammad7613/RL-and-DD/blob/main/FunctionalConnectivityCodes/TransferEntropy/TransferEntropy.py)

Other Kernels are:

- 'PLI', calculates the Phase Lag Index strength between two channels,
- 'LRB_GC' and 'PIB_GC' (Former is recommended) to calculate the Granger Causaulity, and
- 'TE' that Calculates Transfer Entropy

More details and kernels will be available soon!
