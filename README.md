# EEG Processing Tools

There are a broad range of methods to analyse the EEG signals, considering as univariate signal, a multivariate set of variables, and a network. As a part of my master thesis, these analyses is necessary to extract features and answer fundemental questions about the HUMAN Brain.

This Repository is active and alongside three other Repositories ([RL-and-MDD as a team work](https://github.com/mohammad7613/RL-and-DD), [Brain Electrophysiological Signal's Simulation](https://github.com/hamidm317/BrainElectroSignalsSim), and [Probabilistic Selection Task Behvaioral Toolbax](https://github.com/hamidm317/PS_BehavioralData) are Computational Tools of my thesis.

The Covered (or Under Construction üòÅ) tools are listed below, I would appreciate if you could suggest me anything or criticize or use or check or ... my codes!

## Univariate Studies (UC)

Analysing ERP, Power, and Phase in each Frequency Band.

## Multivariate Studies

### Calculation of Connectivity

- PLI (Phase Lag Index)
- Transfer Entropy
- Granger Causality
- PAC (Phase Amplitude Coupling) (UC)
- PLV (Phase Lock Value) (UC)

### Network Studies (UC)

This is part is a huge "FUTURE WORK" and its progress relies on the coming occurences :)
